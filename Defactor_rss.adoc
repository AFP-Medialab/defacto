== Introduction

This document, produced as part of the European (https://defacto-observatoire.fr[DE FACTO]) project, is a guide to set up a RSS pivot format including the ClaimReview and MediaReview specifications defined by the Schema.org consortium, for fact-checking articles.

This guide is intended to provide a common pivot format for the fact-checking supplier’s partners of the DeFacto project. All items listed are important for distributing fact-checking articles with a maximum of metadata.

However, it remains a state of the art of good practices, a recommendation, to set up the richest possible RSS feed for the purposes of automating as much as possible content ingestion within the EDMO regional and national hubs, as well as improving indexing, referencing, and data reuse e.g. to build disinformation databases.

It is therefore more of an objective to be achieved within the framework of the project than a strict requirement.

== Conclusion

This document provides an on-going state-of-the art and recommendation to use ClaimReview and MediaReview within Fact-checking RSS feeds in order to facilitate automation of content ingestion within the De Facto project, that can be useful also for EDMO regional and national hubs platforms. 
Richer in metadata the content will be, easier it will be to build disinformation databases for Social Sciences afterwards. The enrichment in metadata can also take place on each disinformation observatory platform. In this respect, we welcome feedback on this document to continue the discussion on this topic and to improve this document. Feel free to connect with medialab@afp.com for this purpose.
