.ClaimReview structure example
[source,json]
include::{sourcedir}/claimreviw-structure.json[]

==== ItemReviewed for ClaimReview
This property contains the description of the claim that is checked by the fact-checker in ClaimReview. +
The full definition of the itemReviewed property is defined at https://schema.org/Claim.

[cols="2h,2, 5"]
|===
3+| https://schema.org/ItemReviewed[ItemReviewed] Properties

| @type | Fixed Value | Type of the item reviewed. The type is always _Claim_
| author | {type_organization}, {type_person} | Author of the claim being checked. It can be a person or an organization.
| url | {type_url} | Link in support of the verified declaration.
| datePublished | {type_date_time}, {type_date} | Date of the statement
| firstAppearance | {type_url}, {type_creative_work} | Link or description in which the statement first appears.
| appearance | {type_url}, {type_creative_work}, Array[{type_url} or {type_creative_work}] | Links or descriptions of objects in which the statement appears. If there are several, the content is in the form of an array of CreativeWork links or descriptions
|===

===== Appearance with links
The property *_appearance_*, defined on https://schema.org/appearance, indicates the occurrences where the declaration being checked is found. +
The simplest representation is an URL accessible on the internet to the resource where the declaration is located (website, social network, etc.). +
The most complex representation can be a description of material content (book, film, podcast, photography, etc.) of the CreativeWork type. +
If the declaration appears in more than one place, the value of the *_appearance_* is an array. +
The *_appearance_* is found exclusively in an *_itemReview_* of type *_Claim_*.

.Example with a single referenced URL
[source,json]
-----
{
	"appearance": "https://www.facebook.com/100063486369524/videos/2008381422654312"
}
-----

.Example with several URLs
[source,json]
----
{
	"appearance":
	[
    "https://www.facebook.com/100063486369524/videos/2008381422654312",
    "https://twitter.com/baa3465dd891455/status/1486057108307066880"
	]
}
----
NOTE: In the case of several links, the author defined in the itemReview is not necessarily the author of all the referenced links. To associate an author or a creator to each link, you must use the CreativeWork type for each *_appearance_*.

===== Appearance CreativeWork
In order to give a finer description than a declaration, the property *_appearance_* can contain the occurrences of several media described by the type {type_creative_work}. +
Using the CreativeWork type is sufficient to define all types. The list of properties below covers the requirements for embedding media (text, photo, video and audio).

WARNING: the CreativeWork type is a generic type. It is advisable to use https://schema.org/CreativeWork#subtypes[subtypes] like MediaObject, Article, Blog, WebPage, etc. 

[cols="2h,2, 5"]

3+|  https://schema.org/appearance[appearance] Properties
