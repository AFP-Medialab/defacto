==== ItemReviewed for ClaimReview
This property contains the description of the claim that is checked by the fact-checker in ClaimReview. +
The full definition of the itemReviewed property is defined at https://schema.org/Claim.

[cols="2h,2, 5"]
|===
3+| https://schema.org/ItemReviewed[ItemReviewed] Properties

| @type | Fixed Value | Type of the item reviewed. The type is always _Claim_
| author | {type_organization}, {type_person} | Author of the claim being checked. It can be a person or an organization.

|===

=== Appearences
The property *_appearance_*, defined on https://schema.org/appearance, indicates the occurrences where the declaration being checked is found. +
The simplest representation is an URL accessible on the internet to the resource where the declaration is located (website, social network, etc.). +
The most complex representation can be a description of material content (book, film, podcast, photography, etc.) of the CreativeWork type. +
If the declaration appears in more than one place, the value of the *_appearance_* is an array. +
The *_appearance_* is found exclusively in an *_itemReview_* of type *_Claim_*.

.Example with a single referenced URL
[source,json]
-----
{
	"appearance": "https://www.facebook.com/100063486369524/videos/2008381422654312"
}

.Example with several URLs
[source,json]

    "https://twitter.com/baa3465dd891455/status/1486057108307066880"
	]
}

NOTE: In the case of several links, the author defined in the itemReview is not necessarily the author of all referenced links. To associate author or creator to each links, you must use CreativeWork type for each *_appearance_*.
